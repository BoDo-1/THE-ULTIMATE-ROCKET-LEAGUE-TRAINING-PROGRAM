## STAGE 1 - Training the Core Skills

### Part 0 - Adjust to new Controls (if you did not change any controls, skip this step)
###### Estimated time to completion: 20 games
#### Adjust to new Controls
If you decided to go with the controls I suggested above, then your first step is to get used to these new controls. It shouldn't take more than 10 games however it depends on a player to player basis. If you are already using great controls, then feel free to skip this one. However if you changed ANY controls (even just one key-bind) then you must go through this training.

#### Training:

***Do:***  
Play 10 **RANKED** games with your new controls. DO NOT WORRY ABOUT WINNING THE GAME. DON'T WORRY ABOUT DE-RANKING TO A LOWER RANK.

**Completion Challenge:**  
If you de-ranked in those 10 games because of changing controls, you must now re-reach the rank you were before you changed controls.  If you were Gold 3 and went down to Gold 1, you must now go back to Gold 3. **DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP.**

**ANY RANK SHOULD BE ABLE TO COMPLETE THIS TRAINING**

-------------

**Take a training break of 2 days. 
Before moving to next training:**
- Play at least **10** 2v2 games Ranked.
- Play at least **20** 1v1 games Ranked. (VERY IMPORTANT)
- Don't play 3v3 unless you are Platinum 2+
- Have fun, try to win your games, focus on improving, don't worry about losing games but remember to try your hardest.

### Part 1 - Kickoffs - If you suck at these, you'll lose a lot of games.
###### Estimated time to completion: 2-5 days (will be adjusted based on your feedback)
#### Learn to do a better kickoff.
A good kickoff is where you are left with 20-30 boost immediately after the kickoff, and you win the kickoff forcing the ball onto your opponents side.

#### Training:

Definitely watch more, just make sure you know one basic pro-level kickoff. They're not hard to do

***Do:***  
Use this training pack to try out your kickoffs: **2F25-C7AD-8E03-19BC**    
Play 20 games, paying close attention to your new kickoff technique that you learned from the videos. Do not worry about winning the game. Worry about improving your kickoff.

**Completion Challenge:**   
Do this until you consistently have 10-30 boost after your kickoff. **Do not move to the next training until you have a good kickoff.** Use your new kickoff in 10-30 games. You don't need to win every kickoff, just ensure you are winning almost 50%. Don't worry about losing the game. YOU NEED TO FOCUS ON THIS ONE THING. Once you are comfortable doing your new kickoff, move on to the next training.  

**ANY RANK SHOULD BE ABLE TO COMPLETE THIS TRAINING**

### Part 2 - Basic Dribbling - The key to better control on the ground.
###### Estimated time to completion: 1-3 weeks (will be adjusted based on your feedback)
You are probably wondering, why would I learn something that is so advanced right now, right at the beginning of my training? This is because dribbling is the fastest way to develop a very important skill that would normally take you **thousands of matches to develop**. And that is, accurately being able to control your driving on the ground.

**If you are a bronze-gold player it may seem impossible at first, but you must persevere. Every extra second you can dribble the ball on your car is improvement.**

### Training:  
***Watch:***   
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBmgRPOmh98  Dribbling Tutorial | Rocket League

***Do:***  
Use this workshop map: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=964271505
Do 30 minutes to 1 hour dribbling sessions before you start playing ranked. Do as many sessions per day as you want, as long as you do 1 session per day.
Set it as casual and do the training. If you complete the first level, move to the next, and then the next. 
It may take you several days or a week or two. Just do it every day.
 **DO NOT STOP THE TRAINING SESSION UNLESS YOU SEE AT LEAST SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT**

**After training session:**  
Play 5-10 1v1 matches.

**Completion Challenge:**     
Complete levels  1-4 of the workshop dribbling challenge. Once you complete level 4. Do it again. Complete the levels 1-4 at least 5x more times **on separate days**. Once you are comfortable doing this training with ease you are ready for the next training. **There will be more dribbling training assigned in the future.**

### Part 3 - Basic Flying I - Before you can do aerials, you must first learn to fly.
###### Estimated time to completion: 1 week (will be adjusted based on your feedback)
Again, some of you may think that this training is too advanced if you are bronze-platinum, but it's not. All it takes is focused training, dedication, time, and effort.

**This training will develop your 360 flying skills. Ever been in a situation where you thought you were flying at an awkward angle? Where you lost control of your car during an aerial? Well it's because you're not used to flying in that situation.**

There are a couple of factors that come into flying:
1. How your car is angled relative to the ball. Is it upside down? Is it side ways? Is it facing forward?
2. How your camera is facing your car & the ball. Again, is the ball next to your car? Ahead of it? Behind you (redirects & difficult saves are like this)?

For most people flying while the car is facing forward towards the ball with the camera behind the car and the ball is the easiest, and this is what gold - diamond players are usually comfortable with. However to be a good player you need to be able to control your car no matter what angle the camera/ball is in. This training will give you the **absolute basics** of those skills. There will be more flying training in the future.

#### Training:
***Watch:***  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtXE4V7jpvI  Rocket League | Basic Flying Training I

***Do:***  
Do the forward flying training shown in the video until you are comfortable with it.
Do the backward flying training shown in the video until you are comfortable with it.
Combine both as shown in the video until you are comfortable with it.

**Completion Challenge:**     
Do 10 laps of the final training shown in the video. If you mess up during the 10 laps you must restart. You cannot move onto future flying training unless you have mastered this training as they are **much more difficult**. Once you have completed 10 laps you must do it again the next day. You must complete this challenge 3 more times in the next 3 days. **Do not do any other training until this challenge is complete**.

**Do not move to the next training until you can do this challenge easily.**

**ANY RANK SHOULD BE ABLE TO COMPLETE THIS TRAINING**

-------------
**Take a training break of 1 day. 
Before moving to next training:**
- Play at least **10** 2v2 games Ranked.
- Play at least **20** 1v1 games Ranked. (VERY IMPORTANT)
- Don't play 3v3 unless you are Platinum 2+
- Have fun, try to win your games, focus on improving, don't worry about losing games but remember to try your hardest.

### Part 4 - Mastering Air Rolls I - You can't play Rocket League properly without Air Rolls.
###### Estimated time to completion: 2 days (will be adjusted based on your feedback)

Before you can move onto the next Stages that contain more advanced training, it is essential that using Air Rolls becomes second nature and extremely natural and easy to use. You should be able to use the Air Roll control in Rocket League without thinking.

Air Rolling **naturally** is a skill that usually takes hundreds of hours. Players do not really train air rolls that much so it takes them a long time to really master. **You need to master this in as little time as possible if you want to move onto more advanced skills like air dribbles, fast recover, air roll shots, ceiling shots, etc. They ALL use AIR ROLLS.** So in this training you must REALLY focus on mastering Air Rolls as fast as you can by doing intense training with intense focus.

**By doing this training you will develop the skill of using Air Rolls much faster than other players.**

#### Training:
***Watch:***  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFYDVCfAlcE  Rocket League | One of the most ignored basic skills - Air Rolls Basic Training

***Do:***  
Do the final training shown in the video. Do 20-30 minutes for 3 days in a row. 20 to 30 minutes may seem long, and you may be able to master the training in 5-10 minutes, however you need to reinforce it. This needs to be a skill you can use at any time in a game without any thinking involved. It needs to be second nature. It needs to be automatic.

**After training:**
Play 10 games of 2v2 or 1v1 and make sure you are using the Air Roll button every 10 seconds in the game. You need to abuse the Air Roll button. You need to keep using it. You need forcefully use it at first, but eventually it will become second nature. **YOU NEED TO FOCUS ON THIS ONE THING DURING YOUR GAMES. DO NOT WORRY ABOUT LOSING.**

**Completion Challenge:**  
This completion challenge requires something I like call to ***Distraction Training***. Ask any high level player (Diamond 3+) and they will tell you that they can still play at an extremely high level even when they are being distracted or not even focused on the game (still looking at the screen though). That's because they've trained so hard, and they've done it so many times that it's all automatic. It's hardwired into our brains. **It's like our fingers move on their own.** They don't need to think any more. **It's all muscle memory because of the crazy amount of repetition and focused training**.

The completion challenge for this training is to do the training in the video shown above again. However this time you need to turn off your brain, distract yourself in some way, and still be able to do the training, **without any mistakes, and without any real effort**. If it feels uncomfortable, or if you need to focus to complete the training, then you have not completed this challenge.

**Do not move to the next training until you have completed this training.**

**ANY RANK SHOULD BE ABLE TO COMPLETE THIS TRAINING**

**Take a training break of 1 day. 
Before moving to next training:**
